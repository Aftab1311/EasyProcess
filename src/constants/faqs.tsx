    answer: `
      Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):</strong> The cost of acquiring a new customer. It helps you understand the efficiency of your marketing and sales efforts.</p>
      CAC Formula:</strong> CAC = Total Customer Acquisition Costs / Number of Customers Acquired</p>
      <em>Example:</em> Imagine your company spends ₹100,000 on marketing and sales campaigns in a quarter, acquiring 100 new customers. Your CAC would be ₹1,000 (₹100,000 / 100).</p>
      Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV):</strong> CLTV represents the total revenue a customer generates throughout their relationship with your business. It helps you understand the long-term value of your customers.</p>
      CLTV Formula:</strong> CLTV = Average Revenue per User (ARPU) x Average Customer Lifespan</p>
      <em>Example:</em> Let's say your ARPU is ₹500 per month, and the average customer stays with you for 2 years (24 months). Your CLTV would be ₹12,000 (₹500/month x 24 months).</p>
      Market Share:</strong> Market share reflects your company's portion of the total market compared to competitors. It indicates your position within the industry.</p>
      Market Share Formula:</strong> Market Share = Your Company's Revenue / Total Market Revenue</p>
      <em>Example:</em> Suppose your company generates ₹1 million in revenue in a month, and the total market revenue for your industry is ₹10 million that month. Your market share would be 10% (₹1 million / ₹10 million).</p>
      Customer Acquisition Rate (CAR):</strong> CAR indicates the rate at which you acquire new customers over a specific period.</p>
      CAR Formula:</strong> CAR = Number of New Customers Acquired / Time Period (e.g., Month, Quarter, Year)</p>
      Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):</strong> ARPU represents the average revenue generated from each customer over a specific period.</p>
